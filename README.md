Key Features & Insights
SQL-driven cleaning, transformation, and KPI calculations as foundation for robust analytics.

Automated import and refresh mechanisms in Excel ensure KPI cards and charts always reflect the latest data.

Metrics tracked include throughput per material category, machine-level defect rates, energy consumption per unit, and recycled material proportions.

Scalable design suitable for ongoing factory operations with minimal manual intervention.

Usage Instructions
Use the provided SQL script to create and populate MySQL tables and generate aggregated metrics.

Place the CSV file in the configured path, or use SQL import commands to source data.

Open and refresh the Excel dashboard to view dynamic KPIs and explore interactive visuals.

Use provided screenshots for portfolio demonstrations or interview presentations.

Data Source
Columns: Timestamp, Machine ID, Material Category, Material Name, Quantity Used (kg), Recycled Material (%), Energy Consumption (kWh), Production Output (Units), Defect Rate (%)

Origin: Smart Manufacturing Resource Efficiency Dataset (Kaggle)
